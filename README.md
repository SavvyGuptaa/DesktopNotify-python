# DesktopNotify-python

This Python script uses the 'plyer' library to display a desktop notification every 20 seconds. The notification has a title of "TAKE A BREAK!!" and a message of "drink some water", and it disappears after 5 seconds. The loop continues indefinitely until the script is interrupted or terminated.
